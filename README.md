# ðŸŒ¼ Flower Image Classifier

A deep learning project that classifies flower images into 14 categories using transfer learning with PyTorch. This project explores three CNN architectures â€” EfficientNet-B0, ResNet34, and DenseNet121 â€” and evaluates their performance on a curated flower image dataset.

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle â€“ Flower Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/flower-classification)
- Total: 13,642 training images + 98 held-out test images
- Classes: 14 flower species (e.g., rose, tulip, iris, dandelion)

---

## Model Architectures

Implemented transfer learning using pretrained weights from:
- ðŸ”¸ **EfficientNet-B0**
- ðŸ”¹ **ResNet34**
- ðŸ”¸ **DenseNet121** *(best performer)*

All base layers were frozen, and custom classifiers were added for fine-tuning.

## Training Details

- Loss: `CrossEntropyLoss`
- Optimizer: `Adam`
- Augmentations: Resize, rotation, color jitter, horizontal flip
- Trained on GPU via Google Colab

## Performance

| Model        | Val Acc | Test Acc | Train Acc |
|--------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| DenseNet121  | 95.46%  | 94.90%   | 98.08%    |
| ResNet34     | 93.92%  | â€”        | 96.11%    |
| EfficientNet | 89.85%  | â€”        | 86.14%    |

---

## Final Evaluation

- **DenseNet121** evaluated on held-out test set
- Classification Accuracy: **94.90%**
- F1-score (macro): **0.95**
- Confusion Matrix shows strong class separation
